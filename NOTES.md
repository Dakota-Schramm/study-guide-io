# Notes

Biome.js linter has no support for caching?
  - eslint does

- Use navigator.share() to share link to directory where study guides should be downloaded
- Or Mozilla note?? Note: If you want to access or process all the files in a selected folder, you can do so using <input type="file" webkitdirectory="true"/> to select the folder and return all the files it contains.

Maybe use?
