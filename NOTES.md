# Notes

Biome.js linter has no support for caching?
  - eslint does

Maybe use?
- class-variance-authority?
- clsx?

[Cucumber with Playwright](https://www.genui.com/resources/getting-started-with-bdd-using-cucumber-io)

Fix create-guide spec to be a unit test
  - just make sure function at end is processing files correctly. No need to simulate user

Potential Features:
  - Add class progress
    - Allows user to "update" pdfs by adding new class notes and homeworks
    - Sync with calendar?
      - Send reminders to user to review notes on particular days

Make class for user type
User methods
- getCourses
- saveToStorage
  - canReaccess - boolean

Do more research, reading so that can architect the app better going forward
- once have bases covered, start design

Rearchitect before too much further??
- change professor to track? Courseload?
- Plan to allow for diff types in future

Check if Github Copilot can generate tests using Cypress?

NextJS Error Boundaries
- Would be nice if can get to work for pages?
- For now, just create a page component for error handling??
